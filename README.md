# sorting-game

## Description
This project is an introductory exploration of the use of vanilla javascript event listeners and their accompanying functions. The sorting game is styled using bootstrap, with a jumbotron, a form, and cards. Input a name in the form to be randomly sorted into a Hogwarts House, and expel one student at a time by pressing the expel button on a card.
